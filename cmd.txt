To repeatedly run a curl command every 5 seconds using a command line interface, you can use a loop. The exact syntax depends on your operating system

  linux:
while true; do
    curl your_url_here
    sleep 5
done


For Windows, you can use a batch script:

:loop
curl your_url_here
timeout /t 5 >nul
goto loop
